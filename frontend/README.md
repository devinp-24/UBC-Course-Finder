# CPSC 310 PROJECT 

 ### Summary 

- UBC has a lot of courses and therefore a lot of data regarding different sections and their attributes. Our project mimics a Database Management System
where we can add, remove, and list datasets from different UBC terms and then we can perform queries as well as recieve insights (data visualization)
on the data received. We decided to implement **Section Insights** Frontend that provides three different types of insights on the data.
